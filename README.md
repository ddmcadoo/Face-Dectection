Face Detection and Recognition with MTCNN, CNNs, and VGGFace

This project applies deep learningâ€“based face detection and recognition techniques to identify and classify human faces in images. Unlike traditional Haar-cascade methods, this approach uses MTCNN for accurate detection and CNN/VGGFace embeddings for recognition.

Project Overview

Goal: Detect and recognize faces in images using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Techniques Used:

MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network) for face detection (bounding boxes + landmarks).

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract high-level facial features.

VGGFace embeddings to represent faces as feature vectors.

Similarity metrics / classification layer for recognition (cosine similarity, SVM, or softmax
